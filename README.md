## Description

'Maybe' not 'Maeby'. This is an implementation of the Maybe monad similar to that used
[Haskell](http://www.haskell.org/haskellwiki/Maybe). Monads provide a
safe way to create non deterministic programs (for example, when not all
values are known at compile time). The Maybe monad allows programmers to
deal with values that may or may not be undefined.

## Installation

Either include in your Gemfile:

    gem 'ruby-maybe'

Or, install for your system:

    > gem install ruby-maybe
